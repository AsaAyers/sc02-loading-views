### [#2. Loading Views](http://www.backbonerails.com/screencasts/loading-views)

#### Description
Loading views are a great way to indicate that dependencies are loading in the background. They're a powerful tool in any developers toolkit. In this screencast we'll build a fully functioning Loading Component. Oftentimes during Backbone development you'll be fetching resources from a server, or processing data that your views need. A loading view can provides instant feedback to your users. We'll also look at visually showing different kinds of loading effects and transitions.
